# **Improved Hunger**

Everyone is aware of the hunger system within Minecraft, but not all agree with its implementation. Improved Hunger aims to alter that implementation while working within the existing framework provided by the game, with special attention provided to customizing the system.<br />


When using Improved Hunger, you can expect:

* Simple bonuses provided while maintaining full hunger.
* Penalties for maintaining low hunger, and even harsher for no hunger!
* Constant hunger loss (extremely slow by default) while "AFK" or not providing any action.
* Larger meals taking longer to consume, while snacks are much quicker.
* Filling foods and certain meals providing lingering benefits.
* And liberal customization to many aspects of this mod's features.

This mod adds 0 new blocks, items, or mobs!
